## Link to use React
`<script src="http://fb.me/react-0.10.0.min.js"></script>`
this gives to access to the global React object.

#JSX
JSX is the recommended language to write React web apps.
It is a slightly enhanced version of JavaScript that allows you to initialize React components by using an HTML-like syntax in your code
It is compiled down to JavaScript before being interpreted by the browser.
It is optional. You can use regular JavaScript if you want.

#Components
These are the building blocks of react apps.
They are created by calling React.createClass() with an object of options and methods
Each component has a state(an object with data) and each is in is in charge of their own rendering.
  the render() method is called whenever the state changes. Allows for each part to load separately

##onChange
Updates of your controller's state should affect the HTML, not the other way around.
For example(in Real Time Search project): once you've set the value of the text box,
  it will stay the same, ignoring user's key presses, unless you update it in the onChange function.

##Order Form Project
- The real power of React comes when you combine multiple components.
- This allows you to structure your code better and introduce a separation of concerns.
- It will make your code reusable across different parts of your web application.
- The first issue that arises when combining multiple components is how to make them communicate
  -- One way is to pass the data that you need in attributes while initializing them.
      This only works from parent to child components
  -- For communication in the other direction, you can pass one of the parent component's methods as an attribute to the child
      The child can then call this method, and notify the parent of events.

##Image app with AJAX
This example showed how you can combine react with jQuery, and how to load results via AJAX.
React lets you use whatever other libraries you are comfortable with.
Notice that our example uses the same picture component when rendering the picture list and the favorite list
  This reuse is one of the benefits to organizing your code into components.

#Conclusion
React allows you to give clean structure to your application and promote code reuse.
Its powerful virtual DOM allows the framework to speed up complex interfaces.
React is suitable for rendering on the server side as well as the client side.
  This makes it possible to build isomorphic apps that transition seamlessly between client and server
